About Electronic Design Automation (EDA) Industry
=================================================

This repository site lists my learnings of having been associated with the EDA industry for over 8 years now.  EDA industry has taken huge leaps.  The basic slide-deck is an effort made to make user aware of the Electronics Industry, and then appreciate the contributions of the latest advancements in EDA industry towards Electronics.  The slide-deck is accessible from [here]({{ site.repository-path }}/{{ site.baseurl }}/blob/{{ site.branch }}/slide-deck/chapter_1_ElectronicsIndustryInBrief.pptx?raw=true).



Building Virtual Platforms
==========================

Virtual platforms are pieces of software that when glued together help us in mimicing the behavior of a physical hardware.

The physical target could be any one of the following:
- Can be a plain digital system, or
- An analog system, or
- A mixed-signal system (Analog + Digital)

Virtual platforms have really come of age.  I'll be more interested in to pertain the discussions to two topics of interest here:
- System-on-Chip (SoC)
- Network-on-Chip (NoC)



About the Learning Curve
========================

Well, learning a new domain is always challenging.  But, it is fun too.  Before diving in to know more about `virtual prototying`, it is good to start with few basic refreshers.  The plan is to appreciate few concepts encompassing
- simulations v/s emulations:
- basic digital-logic
- virtual prototyping using Accellera SystemC
- some analogy with HDL (VHDL more specifically)
- faster modelling concepts using TLM
